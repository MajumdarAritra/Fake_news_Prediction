# fake_news_Prediction<br>
# Overview<br>
The Fake News Prediction project aims to classify news articles as either "Fake" or "Real" using machine learning algorithms. The project involves preprocessing text data, training various classification models, and evaluating their performance to detect misinformation effectively.<br>

# Features<br>
Text Preprocessing: Techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.<br>
Feature Extraction: Use of methods like Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.<br>
Model Training: Training various classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.<br>
Model Evaluation: Metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score to assess model performance.
